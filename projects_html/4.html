            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p>Our entry for the NUS LifeHack 2022 Hackathon. The aim of this application was to create a UI where food donators and receivers can easily list and browse items. It also enables receivers to directly communicate with donators through a simple tap. The application was imagined to be more complex as a web application, however, due to the underestimation of the conversion from Figma to code, we opted for a functional UI instead. A great difficulty in the development of this idea was the fact that we were not well versed in using the various APIs such as Firebase. However, through this opportunity, we managed to develop a greater understanding of the usage of APIs which would be useful for future projects.  </p>
