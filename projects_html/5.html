            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p>After chancing upon this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecMlLUuiE4&ab_channel=LearnCodeByGaming">video</a>, 
                I decided to follow through his tutorial to try using OpenCV and Python to get the highest score in the shortest time in the practice range of 
                the game 'Valorant'. However, the filters used could not effectively get rid of the noise in the shooting range due to the various artifacts, so there was only
                a limited degree of success. I turned to a simpler game in Human Benchmark where I used the game to play through the Aim Tracker and Visual Memory game, of which
                the bot had a great degree of success, consistenly scoring above the 99th percentile. A difficulty of creating this bot was the usage of Object Oriented Programming
                in the given sample code. There's a lot of use in OOP in terms of its organisation and maintenance, I definitely see myself implementing OOP in my future projects.</p>
