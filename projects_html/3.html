            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p>This was a personal project that I made for my father after he complained about the difficulties in calculation of laundry prices as well as keeping track of monthly earnings. He was also boggled down by the difficulty of keeping track of payments owed. Using the knowledge gained from DSTA BrainHack 2022, I embarked on my first personal project. A great difficulty of this project was the implementation of a database to keep track of earnings and debt even after application closure, which was mitigated using AsyncStorage. Upon further use of the application, a future improvement would be more limitations in user input to avoid corruption of the stored data. </p>
