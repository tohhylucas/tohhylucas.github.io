            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p> Traffic Light Showdown is a 1 vs 1 game that tests reaction speed and accuracy. 
                The player will see a coloured word on the bus and the light posts in the middle indicate whether the players should press according to the word or colour. 
                The fastest player to press the correct answer within the round duration is awarded a point for that round. 
                There will be 9 rounds, with the difficulty level increasing every 3 rounds with a shorter round duration. 
                The player with the highest score at the end of 9 rounds wins the game.

                This project was built using a FPGA Alchitry Io programmed using Lucid. The game works by using states that change when the buttons are pressed.
                In my role in this project, I was involved in the programming of the ALU that performs computations in the states. I was also involved with the circuits that ensure signals from the FPGAs are reflected in the components.
                By using Fusion360, I created supports as well as the front panel using 3D printing and laser cutting.
